Nokia Phone Message Conversion Utility
The Nokia Phone Message Conversion Utility is a Node.js project built using TypeScript and Express.js. It offers a unique approach to performing various message conversions, drawing inspiration from the nostalgic days of Nokia mobile phones. This utility is designed to replicate the communication experience between Earth and Mars, showcasing its capabilities through creative scenarios.

Project Highlights
Message Conversion: This utility specializes in converting messages using a distinctive Nokia phone reference. Messages can be transformed from their original form to a Nokia-inspired version, adding a touch of nostalgia to modern communication.

Two-Way Communication: The utility enables two-way message conversion, allowing messages to be translated from Earth to Mars and vice versa. This whimsical take on interplanetary communication adds an element of fun to the project.

SQLite3 Database Integration: To enhance functionality, the utility leverages an in-memory SQLite3 database to store logs of the message conversion process. This feature provides users with a traceable history of their communication adventures.

Event-Driven Architecture: The project follows an event-based programming approach, ensuring efficient and responsive handling of various conversion tasks. This architecture contributes to the utility's performance and scalability.
